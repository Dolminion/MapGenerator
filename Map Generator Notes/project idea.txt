Zones, with parameters
	Filled with squares - placed using a cellular automaton?, informed by zone parameters.



Or

User selects points on blank map, choosing biome
	use voronoi diagram (and delaunay?) to map biome shapes, generate contents


Blocks are generated outwards from click	(algorithm? - 	select area of effect, cellular automoton using
								already filled squares AND biome defaults for
								unfilled squares, each biome has params)
	Generate visibly using time constraints 

optional:
	User chooses type of blank map to generate
	User chooses parameters, clicks on generated blank map

rock - rocks/mountain
snow - snow/mountain top
